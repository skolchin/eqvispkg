This package implements some functions to visualize the data of Significant Earthquakes dataset provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The package was written for the Capstone project  assignment for the  Johns Hopkins University "Mastering Software Development in R" specialization on Coursera.


## The Data

The dataset is available at the NOAA website (<a href="https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?type_0=Exact&query_0=$ID&t=101650&s=13&d=189&dfn=signif.txt">download link</a>. 

The dataset contains data for all majour earthquakes and tsunamis starting from 2150 B.C. Dataset definition is available at the site.

The package contains the downloaded file as of the June 2018/

## Loading and cleaning the data

To load the dataset, use `eq_load_data()` function:
```{r load_data}
raw_data <- eq_load_data("signif.txt")
```
